        <h3>ANZ Indoor League</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            The ANZ League indoor league series is a fun event where archers of all skill levels can compete with each other.
            The League series does not separate archers into divisions based on age or gender, only the bow type you shoot determines
            what division you are in.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The Overall Championship shall be determined based on the highest aggregate score
                            of each archer’s top 10 submitted scores.
                        </li>

                        i. An archer’s handicap for each week is calculated = (360 – mean average of
                        previous rounds shot to date in the calendar year). This handicap is added
                        to the archers score to give an adjusted total.
