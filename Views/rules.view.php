        <h3>Starts : Monday 7th May

        <p>
            The ANZ League indoor league series is a fun event where archers of all skill levels can compete with each other.
            The League series does not separate archers into divisions based on age or gender; only the bow type you shoot determines
            what division you are in.
            <br>
            This year we are fortunate to have Hoyt Archery and Pats-Archery sponsoring the event with some really awesome prizes for the winners of the
            Compound and Recurve Handicap and Overall divisions. Prizes to be announced over the coming weeks

                                previous rounds shot to date in the calendar year). This handicap is added
                                to the archers score to give an adjusted total.
